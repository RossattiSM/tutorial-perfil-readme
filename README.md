## First Steps in this New Adventure

<p align="justify">
<ul>
  <li> Create a new repository which contains the <i> same name </i> as <b> your Github username </b> </li> 
  <li> Select the <i> "Add a Readme file" </i> checkbox to add a Readme to personalize your profile </li> 
  <li> Edit the file easily with this <b> <i> tips </i> </b> I give you in this repo ‚ú® </li> 
</ul>
 </p>

## ü§ì Markdown or HTML, that is the question

<p align="justify">
Why choose if you can use both! To edit the Readme file, you can use either Markdown or HTML, the latter with some limitations that are discovered on the way. Do not worry about not knowing them because, in addition to being simple, in this tutorial I integrate code for you to do the famous <i> copypaste</i>. And if not, Saint Google will help you.
 </p>

## Add Headings

<p align="justify">
The most simple way to add headings into your file is with <i> Markdown </i>, and to do so you can use <b> hash marks </b> (#). The amount used represents the size of the letter: the more hash marks, the smaller the letters. You can also use HTML.
 </p>

| Description     | Markdown        | HTML                    | Preview                       
| ---             | ---             | ---                     | ---                                     
| Heading Level 1 | `# Heading 1 `  |  `<h1> Heading 1 </h1>` |  <h1> Heading 1 </h1>
| Heading Level 2 | `## Heading 2 ` |  `<h2> Heading 2 </h2>` |  <h2> Heading 2 </h2>
| Heading Level 3 | `### Heading 3 ` |  `<h3> Heading 3 </h3>` |  <h3> Heading 3 </h3>
| Heading Level 4 | `#### Heading 4 `  |  `<h4> Heading 4 </h4>` |  <h4> Heading 4 </h4>
| Heading Level 5 | `##### Heading 5 ` |  `<h5> Heading 5 </h5>` |  <h5> Heading 5 </h5>
| Heading Level 6 | `###### Heading 6 ` |  `<h6> Heading 6 </h6>` |  <h6> Heading 6 </h6>

<p align="justify">
Something really useful about headings is that they have an <i> automatically generated link </i> showed in the hamburger menu (‚ò∞) of the Readme file (you can find it up and to the left).
</p>

## Edit Text

<p align="justify">
To <i> generate text </i>, type as normal. If it is necessary, add HTML tags to make it more pleasing to the eye. You'll notice that there are limitations when trying to embellish a Readme. </p>

| Description | Markdown         | HTML                    | Preview                       
| ---         | ---              | ---                     | ---                                     
| Normal      | ` Normal `       |  ` Normal `             |  Normal
| Bold        | ` ** Bold ** `   |  ` <b> Bold </b> `      |  <b> Bold </b>
| Italics     | ` * Italics *  ` |  ` <i> Italics </i> `   |  <i> Italics </i>
| Justified   | Can't be done    |  ` <p align="justify"> Justified </p> ` |  Justified
| Centered    | Can't be done    |  ` <p align="center"> Centered </p> `   |  Centered 

<b> EMOJIS </b> <br> 
You can also use <i>  emojis </i> ü§©üòé. <a href="https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908"> Here is a list </a> with the code you need to add them to your text.

## Links üîó

To <i>link </i> to other pages on and off Github, you can also use both languages. I personally use HTML because it allows me to do more things than Markdown, like centering the link for example. <br>

| Description | Markdown         | HTML                                                                             | Preview                       
| ---         | ---              | ---                                                                              | ---                                     
| Link        | ` 	[Link](https://github.com/rossattism/profile-readme-tutorial) `       |  ` <a href="https://github.com/rossattism/profile-readme-tutorial"> Link </a> `  | <a href="https://github.com/rossattism/profile-readme-tutorial"> Link </a>
 
## Insert images

Markdown and HTML can also be used with <i> images </i>. I also prefer HTML for this purpose, because it allows to use style elements. There are two ways: images inserted from other sites by using their URL or images within the Readme itself. For this last way, you have to upload the image to the repository manually and thus be able to add the address. <br>

| Description | Markdown         | HTML                                                                               | Preview                                         
| ---         | ---              | ---                                                                                | ---            
| Image       | ` ![description of image](url to image) `       |  ` <img src="url of image" alt="description of image" /> ` |  <img src="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.1102897194.2281/pp,840x830-pad,1000x1000,f8f8f8.jpg" alt="RTFM" style="heigth:150px; width: 150px" />

Code to change the size of an image:
```
<img src="url of image" alt="description of image" style="heigth:150px; width: 150px" />
```

Code to center an image: 
```
<p align="center">
<img src="url of image" alt="description of image" />
</p>
```

## Icons

A fun and visual way to edit your Github profile is to <i>add icons </i> with the languages you know or would like to learn so you can show it off to recruiters. <b>Icons are added the same as images. </b> <br>

| Description | Markdown         | HTML                                                                           | Preview                                         
| ---         | ---              | ---                                                                            | ---            
| Icon        | ` ![description of icon](url to icon) ` | ` <img src="url of icon" alt="description of icon" /> ` | <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=linkedin" alt="linkedin logo" />

These are <i> links to Github repositories </i> with icons that may interest you: <br>
<a href="https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons"> Skill Icons </a> <br>
<a href="https://github.com/marwin1991/profile-technology-icons"> Technology Icons </a> <br>

## Badges üòé

<i> Badges </i> are <b> interactive pictures </b> that can be added to your profile and make it more <b> fun or attractive </b> to whoever sees it. Some examples of what these badges can do are: count how many people access a github profile, count the weight of code within a repository, or the number of files there are. There are many different badges. Each one has its particular code to insert it into the Readme file. <br>

These are links to repositories with Badges: <br>

<a href="https://github.com/Naereen/badges"> More badges </a> <br>

## 42 Community

If you click <a href="https://github.com/stars/rossattism/lists/4-2"> here </a>, you will be taken to a list I have made of useful repositories for students. Some include tips and code, others include badges that shows your 42's student profile to the world. <br>

## Profile Example

To close, this would be a code example of a simple profile:
```
# Hello World! üëã

- ‚ú® I'm currently learning <b> HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </b>
- üëÄ I'm intrested in <b> React. </b>

# Social Links
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"> Linkedin </a> <br>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/"> Instagram </a> <br>
<a href="https://github.com"> Github </a> <br>

<hr>

Thanks for visiting my profile!
```

This is how it would look: <br>
